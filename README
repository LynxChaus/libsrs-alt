--with-base64compat

This option alters the behaviour of the base64 encoder built 
in to libsrs_alt to use the non-standard characters '_' and 
'.' instead of '+' and '/'. This move vastly improves the 
compatibility of SRS with MTAs. The option comes highly 
recommended.

The switch is backward compatible, in that the base64 
decoder will still recognise '+' and '/' as valid base64 
characters.

However, it should be noted that this breaks the "SRS 
Compliancy" (which is a rough standard at best).
