v0.3 released - 24 Jun 2004
---------------------------

24 Jun 2004
    - Adjusted hash data to make the library compliant with other SRS implementations
        (NOTE: This actually makes the library slightly less efficient, but for the

v0.2 released - 4 Jun 2004
--------------------------

4 Jun 2004
    - Added srs_set_option with support for
        - optional use of hash with SRS0

    - Changed default hash length to 6 (security concerns)
